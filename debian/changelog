  * Implementing fixed-wing operation with a joystick
  * Implementing the rest of parameter parsing and forces + moments calculations
  * Parameterizing techpod mesh files and aerodynamic parameters
  * Adding xacro parameter for wind speed mean
  * The ROS interface plugin is now attached to a static model in the world rather than being attahed to the firefly MAV.
  * Removed dead code from the .xacro macro for the ROS interface plugin.
  * Removed dead commented code.
  * More attempted tweaks to fix errors with substitutaion_args/xacro.py. Added better debug print.
  * Odometry message now being captured by ROS interface plugin and published to ROS framework. Hovering example now works again.
  * ROS interface plugin publishing actuators and link state messages to ROS platform
  * ROS message interface plugin now converts magnetic field messages and publishes to ROS.
  * Changed the name of the robot location GPS message to nav_sat_fix (since there is more than one GPS message type).
  * Fixed issue with topic name differences between IMU/GPS plugins and the interface plugin.
  * New Gazebo message interface plugin is loading correctly when hover sim is launched.
  * Gazebo is now outputting debug messages to the console (verbose mode is turned on through launch file).
  * The ROS interface plugin is now attached to a static model in the world rather than being attahed to the firefly MAV.
  * Removed dead code from the .xacro macro for the ROS interface plugin.

  * change euroc to neo
  * Delete neo9_generic_odometry_sensor.gazebo
  * Delete neo11_generic_odometry_sensor.gazebo
  * change euroc_hex to neo11
  * add neo11
  * add neo9 to rotors

  * Adding GPS to components snipets and mounting it on a fixed-wing Techpod model
  * Fixing small details and removing references to gazebo plugins
  * Adding Techpod URDF desciption files and a general URDF for fixed-wing
  * Adding meshes for Techpod, extracted from actual CAD model
  * Magnetometer refactoring to make use of constexpr and proper transform convention
  * Modifying component_snipets to use the new custom magnetometer plugin
  * Adding some noise based on ADIS16448 specs
  * Adding a macro for magnetometer component
  * Fixing all the RotorS launch files to work with more generic description files
  * Adding 'wait_to_record_bag' parameter to all quad base description files
  * Adding ability to start and stop rosbag recording on command
  * Fixing a couple of small bugs in mavlink interface plugin
  * Refactoring mavlink interface plugin more
  * Adding vehicle and controller parameter files for new models
  * Removing unfinished parts of px4 dummy controller and gazebo mavlink interface. Refactoring gazebo mavlink interface.
  * Removing the unfinished wing plugin and the VTOL model
  * Making the URDF description files more generic
  * Adding 'world-name' as an argument to most launch files
  * added optical link also to stereo camera
  * add optical joint for camera
  * fix namespace variable
    missing $ sign
  * Updated to use mavros_msgs. Optionally add mavlink_interface to gazebo models
  * started cleanup of odometry plugin
  * removed unnecessary mav_name_suffix and switched to using waypoint_publisher
    Added an optional delay parameter in the waypoint publisher to publish a
    waypoint at a later instance of time.
  * Update hummingbird.xacro
    use "mav_name" arg which has an additional suffix, in order to prevent namespace conflict when launching several mavs of the same type.
  * Update pelican.xacro
    use "mav_name" arg which has an additional suffix, in order to prevent namespace conflict when launching several mavs of the same type.
  * Update firefly.xacro
    use "mav_name" arg which has an additional suffix, in order to prevent namespace conflict when launching several mavs of the same type.
  * switch url website in package.xml to github repo
  * Added the mavlink interface plugin to the iris model via sdf file
  * replace middle dot with a period
  * update iris with upstream changes
  * update ardrone with upstream changes
  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into px4_nodes_upstreammerge3
  * remove old/outdated urdf/xacro files
  * update launch and xacro files to new names, update use of odometry plugin
  * move px4 files to new directories
